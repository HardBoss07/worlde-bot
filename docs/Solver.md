These are the suggested words:
- sally 0.12534
- salsa 0.11568
- Total Words Left: 2

**Why this happens:**
This happens since the wordlist word remover misses certain words because the misplaced letter already appears at the correct position before and misses it because:
- `a` is at pos 1 (correct)
- `s` is at pos 0 (correct)
- But `a` also appears at position 3 (this position was flagged as misplaced for `a`)
- `s` doesnâ€™t appear at position 4 (ok)
